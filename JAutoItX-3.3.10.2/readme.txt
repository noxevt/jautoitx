What are AutoIt and AutoItX?
  AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating 
  the Windows GUI. It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement 
  and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible 
  or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys).

  AutoItX is a DLL version of AutoIt v3 that provides a subset of the features 
  of AutoIt via an ActiveX/COM and DLL interface. This means that you can add 
  AutoIt-like features to your favourite scripting and programming languages, 
  e.g. VB, VBScript, Delphi, C, C++, Kixtart, and most other languages that 
  support the use of DLLs.
