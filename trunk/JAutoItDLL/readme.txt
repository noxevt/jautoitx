What are AutoIt and AutoItDLL?
  AutoIt is a simple tool that can simulate key presses, mouse movements 
  and window commands (maximize, minimize, wait for, etc.) in order to 
  automate any windows based task (or even windowed DOS tasks).
  
  AutoItDLL is a pure DLL version of AutoIt.  It allows you to perform the following types of functions:
    1. Sending keystrokes and mouse clicks (all characters, keyboard layout independent). 
    2. Window functions (e.g. minimizing, hiding, restoring, waiting for, activating (even under Win98/NT2000)). 
    3. INI file reading and writing. 
    4. Simple clipboard (text) commands. 
    5. Shutdown and reboot commands (including a forced reboot that works under both 9x and NT). 
    6. Blocking input under Windows NT4 SP6 and 2000/XP.
